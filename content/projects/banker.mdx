## Problem

Bankers and finance professionals needed a clean, ad-free tool to quickly calculate credit terms and share results with clients. Existing apps were cluttered with ads and lacked professional sharing features.

## Approach

Built a native mobile app with React Native and Expo, focusing on a clean UI and instant calculations. Implemented share functionality so professionals can send formatted results directly to clients.

## Results

- Published on the App Store
- Ad-free experience for professional use
- Quick calculation with shareable results
