## Problem

Teams and groups needed a quick way to run polls and see results in real-time without signing up for complex survey tools.

## Approach

Built a web app with React and Firebase Realtime Database. Users create a poll with up to 6 options, share a link, and watch votes come in live. No sign-up required.

## Results

- Real-time vote tracking with Firebase
- Shareable links for easy distribution
- Clean, minimal UI focused on the voting experience
