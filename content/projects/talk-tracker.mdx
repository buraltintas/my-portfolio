## Problem

In meetings, it's easy to lose track of who has spoken and who hasn't. Meeting facilitators needed a simple tool to track participation.

## Approach

Created a lightweight React app where facilitators can add participant names before a meeting and toggle their status during the meeting to track who has contributed.

## Results

- Simple, focused tool for meeting management
- One-click tracking of participant contributions
- No sign-up required, works instantly
