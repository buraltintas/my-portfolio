## Problem

Shoppers often lose track of spending at the grocery store and face surprises at the cashier. They needed a simple way to set a budget and track items in real-time.

## Approach

Designed a minimalist mobile app with React Native that lets users create a grocery list, set a target budget, and enter prices as they shop. The app shows running totals and budget status.

## Results

- Published on the App Store
- Helps users stay within budget while shopping
- Simple, intuitive interface for quick use in-store
